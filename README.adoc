= How to sort Antora components and versions in the UI

This project shows several ways to sort components and versions in an Antora documentation project using a customized UI.

In increasing sophistication, these are:

* Silly: reversing the default component order
* Simple: basic configuration of component order
* Full: more sophisticated configuration of component order
* Component-version: sorting both components and versions.

== Prerequisites

You need node and npm installed.

== Instructions

Run:

[source,console]
----
npm run clean-install
npm run build
----

This will install all needed modules and build all four examples.

== Silly

This has no configuration, and is a model if you want to write an unconfigurable hard-coded sorter.

== Simple

This is configured with a playbook key `asciidoc.attributes.page-component-sort-order` with a comma-separated list of components to show, in order.

== Full

This is configured with a playbook key `asciidoc.attributes.page-component-sort-order`.

The key value is a comma-separated list of specifiers:

Required component::
  An explicit component name is placed in the order specified if present and warned if missing.
Hidden component::
  A component name prefixed with '!' is ommitted if present and warned if missing.
Optional hidden component::
  A component name prefixed with '!' and suffixed with '?' is ommitted if present.
Wildcard include::
  A '\*' includes all components not otherwise mentioned, in their original order, at the location of the '*'

== Component-version

This is configured with a playbook key `asciidoc.attributes.page-component-sort-order` and component descriptor keys `asciidoc.attributes.version-sort-key`.

Component sorting configuration (playbook `asciidoc.attributes.page-component-sort-order` key)::
The key value is a comma-separated list of specifiers:
Required component:::
An explicit component name is placed in the order specified if present and warned if missing.
Optional component:::
A component name suffixed with '?'::: is placed in the order specified if present.
Hidden component:::
A component name prefixed with '!' is ommitted if present and warned if missing.
Optional hidden component:::
A component name prefixed with '!' and suffixed with '?' is ommitted if present.
Wildcard include:::
A '\*' includes all components not otherwise mentioned, in their original order, at the location of the '*'
Wildcard hide:::
A '!*' causes all components not otherwise mentioned to be excluded.
Version sorting configuration, per component::
* Version sorting is specified in the component descriptor with the `asciidoc.attributes.version-sort-key` key.
* Versions with this key are ordered in reverse lexicographical order of key value.
* Versions without this key are ordered after those with the key, in the original order.
* The key value of '!' causes the version to be hidden.
